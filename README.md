## Configuration & API Keys

This app uses the following APIs:
- [OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution)
- [GNews API](https://gnews.io/docs/)

API keys are currently hardcoded in `lib/config/api_config.dart`:
```dart
class ApiConfig {
  static const String openweathermapApiKey = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY';
  static const String gnewsApiKey = 'YOUR_GNEWS_API_KEY';
}
```
<b>For production:</b> Move API keys to environment variables or secure storage. See [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) for best practices.
